A client/server wrapper around `clues.js`, providing client access to clues solving to a browser or node client with local fact/logic space.  

### `reptiles-server`
The server is initialized by providing base logic and optionally some options `function(logic,options)`

Available options are:
* `safe` : Disregards any input that would otherwise overwrite a logic function with same name
* `debug` Provide debug information with error messages
* `stringify` Use provided stringify function instead of default

The initialized server is a function that can be placed into `express` paths.  If no arguments are given to the function, the API access is unrestricted, with requested variables (comma-delimited) in the `req.param.fn`.  If a specific array of values is given to the function, it will solve those variables only.  The user must provide all the inputs either as a JSON blob in the body and/or as querystring variables.

Example:
```
express()
  .use(bodyParser.json())
  .post('/api/:fn',reptilesServer(api))
```

### `reptiles-client`
The client can be loaded in a browser or required into node.js and inherits  `clues.js` .  A client is initialized by `reptile(logic,inputs,options)` and can subsequently be used to solve for facts / render widgets based on data.  The inputs should be a json array of known local facts.  The following options can be specified
* `url` The default base url for the reptiles-server, by default '/api/'
* `request` A list of options provided to the request object (if run on node)
* `delay` The client tries to aggregate multiple request for data into a single request. 
* `applyFn` An optional function run every time a fact has been resolved

In addition to providing all standard `clues.js` functions, the client also provides the following (browser only):
* `render(element)`  This function looks at the `data-reptile` attribute and solves for the logic function with the same name.   The logic function can use the argument `element` to gain access to the dom element itself.  If `data-reptile` is comma delimited the client will try to resolve the first value and then moving on to the next if the first resulted in an error, etc.
* `renderAll(element)` This function will call `render(element)` on all subnodes that have `data-reptile` defined.

### 'inject(obj, prop, $global)'
This function takes the fact object as first argument and an object with properties that should be injected as the second argument.  This function makes it easy to mock any endpoints in a logic tree by simply injecting the intended values in the right places.  The key for each injected property should be the full path (dot notation) and the value can be a function or an absolute value.   If the injection already overrides a pre-existing value/function the original will be available under `original_'+propertyname.

Example:

```js
const Db = {
  user : function(userid) {
    return database.query('users where usedid = ?',[userid])
  }
};

const Logic = {
  db : function(userid) {
    return Object.create(Db,{
      userid: {value: userid}
    });
  },
  userid : ['input.userid',String]
};

let injected = function($global) {
  return inject(Object.create(Logic), {
    'userid': function(original_userid) {
      return 'test_'+original_userid;
    },
    'db.user' : function(userid) {
      return { desc: 'this is an injected response', userid: userid}
    }
  },$global);
};

clues(injected,'db.user',{input:{userid:'johndoe'}})
  .then(console.log,console.log);
```

### `inspect`

Inspect provides an endpoint that allows graphical inspection (using viz.js) of the api tree under a reptile-server. It takes the root instance to be inspected as an argument.

Simply put in the logic class, something like:
```js
const reptileServer = require('clues/util/reptile-server');
const inspect = require('clues/util/inspect');

class Logic {
  method a() {}
  method b() {}

  inspect() {
    return inspect(this);
  }
}

express()
  .use('/api',reptileServer(Logic))
  .listen(3003);
```

To inspect the root you simple go to path
`http://localhost:3003/api/inspect/app`

Method a can be inspected by:
`http://localhost:3003/api/inspect/app/a`
